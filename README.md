# 🧵 Multi Threads

A high-performance C program that parallelizes the sorting process. It splits an integer array into halves, spawns two concurrent threads to sort the sublists, and employs a third merging thread to assemble the final sorted result.

## 🚀 1. Build the program

To compile `main.c` into the `main` executable:

```bash
make
```

## 🏃 2. Run the program

After building, run the executable:

```bash
./main
```

## 🧹 3. Clean up

To remove the compiled binary and keep your workspace tidy:

```bash
make clean
```
